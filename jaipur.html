<td width="500px" style="text-align:left"> I went to Jaipur , Rajasthan with my family and now
 I am giving a pinch of what I saw there .
Jaipur , It is known as the pink city of India. I arrived at that place by rail. The Railway Station was very well 
architect with several Big wall paintings of Maharajas lived there. After coming out of the station ,
 We boarded a taxi and went to my maternal uncle's home. Due to fatigue, we decided to travel the next day.
On the next day in the morning, We boarded a bus and went to many historical sit
es like Amber Fort and Palace , Hawa Mahal , City Palace, Nahargarh Fort , Jaigar Fort
 , Monkey temple and many other alluring places. Apart from the historical monuments, it has the offices of the embassies, 
 high commissions, trading firms and many other organisations. Jaipur indeed, is a treasure-chest of antiquity and heart of India. 
 After staying there for a couple of weeks. We all got back to our home through rail.
It was great experience and it was nice place for knowing new things.
