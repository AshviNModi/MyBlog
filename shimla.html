<td width="500px" style="text-align:left"> It was a wonderful experience when I visited Shimla for the first time with my family. 
I just want to share one of the good experience of my life. when I visited beautiful place  Shimla. We went there in early December ,
 it was such a nice experience starting from the train in which we travelled from Kalka Station.
 The journey is very comfortable as well as full of site seeing. 
 After reaching Shimla we had a very good time when we visited Kufriand many other places. 
 Last but not the least one of the famous attractions of Shimla is Mall Road is also one of the good places, 
 the Church that is situated there near Mall Road is a very good place and one must see it.

I advise you all to go and visit Shimla in month of Nov-Feb.
